# PeerToPeer Example
This is a C# program that implements a simple peer-to-peer chat client using TCP/IP sockets. The program allows users to connect to each other by specifying their IP addresses and exchange messages in real-time.
# Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution to compile the program.
3. Run the program and enter your name when prompted.
4. Retrieve your external IP address by visiting a website like "icanhazip.com" and enter it when prompted.
5. Connect to a peer by entering their IP address when prompted.
6. Type a message to send to your peer and press enter.
7. Receive messages from your peer in real-time as they are sent.
Note: You will need to have a peer to connect to in order to use the program effectively. You can run the program on two separate machines to simulate a peer-to-peer chat, or connect to a friend's machine if they are also running the program.
